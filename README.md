# Gallery-Lightbox-Search
This is a responsive gallery search filter that can filter the gallery images depending on what the user types in the search bar. When a 
user clicks on an image, the image becomes larger and the caption is shown. To see it in action you can copy or 
click this link: https://corralc.github.io/gallery-lightbox-search/.

## How it works
When a user types in part or all of the caption/alt text of an image, that image will stay visible while other images that don't meet the 
match become invisible.

### Some Examples
When a user types "I love" in the search bar, 3 images are visible out of the 12

<img src = "examples\lightbox-search-gallery-ex1.jpg" width="700">

As you can see each image caption includes the sentence I love

<img src = "examples\lightbox-search-gallery-ex2.jpg" width="700">
<img src = "examples\lightbox-search-gallery-ex3.jpg" width="700">
<img src = "examples\lightbox-search-gallery-ex4.jpg" width="700">

The images are searchable by their alt text as well.

These images can be cycled through and the last image cycles through the first image.
The user can only cycle through images that are visible.
